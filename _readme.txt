KESSITO 2021054 CHANGES:
------------------------------------ADDED: 
conc_full_cylTopBot.m

-----------------------------------CHANGED:
sim_measurements.m : added conc_full_cylTopBot as measurement grid to get a bottom and cap on cylinder measurements
sim_measurements.m : changed plot to ddB scale to get better insight
step4.m : changed plot to ddB scale to get better insight
step4.m : added error plot
conc_full_cylTopBot.m : fixed bug in line 14 which caused a double point
step0: added c (speed of sound in air)
step3: made coordinates of outputgrid equal to input (simulation grid 
cart_disc_grid:changed default range to 1-2 meter
